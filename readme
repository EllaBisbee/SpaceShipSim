12/7/18

Our program is a 3D implementation of the vehicle assignment from
earlier in the semester. It includes a head tracker to be able to
control the perspective of the screen using your head. We allow users
to go to the perspective of an individual spaceship as well as overall
bird's-eye perspective. Users can add spaceships, stop all spaceships,
change the speed of individual spaceships, and remove an individual
spaceship. Individal spaceships are selected through mouse picking.

To run this program, open the "shipSim.html" file in any browser that
supports WebGL. We used Google Chrome to test this.
